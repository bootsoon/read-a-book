# ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS

A GUIDE TO CRITICAL THINKING, ELEVENTH EDITION

M.Neil Browne, Stuart M. Keeley Bowling Green State University

## PREFACE

"I know it's good to be a critical thinker and to be able to ask lots of good questions, but I don't know what questions to ask or how to ask them." We are now on our 11th edition of a book that we wrote in response to `sensing` the need for providing more `guidance` for the process of effectively asking critical questions. Democracy works best with a public capable of critical thinking! We can be more confident of our decisions and beliefs when we have formed them after asking critical questions. We can be proud that before anything gets into our heads, it passes particular standards that we respect.

From the beginning, our book has been a work in progress, as we continue to `incorporate` input from our students and from the many teachers using this book. While we continue to be immensely pleased by this book's success and the positive feedback from many readers from many countries, we cannot also help but notice the need for a greater-than-ever `expansion` of efforts to educate the public in "asking the right questions." Selecting which new suggestions to `embrace` and which to `reject` has become increasingly difficult. We are `bombarded` daily with efforts to `persuade` us, many of which are highly `polarized` and `appeal` much more to the emotional part of the brain than to the reasoning part. We encounter a general, immense disrespect for evidence, the `sloppy` use of language, and substitution of `hollering` for reason in so much of our public discussion. "`Truthiness`," or a lack of concern for the truth, becomes more and more common.   

Always `uppermost` in our mind has been the desire to retain the primary attributes of *Asking the Right Questions*, while adjusting to new `emphases` in our own thought and the evolving needs of our readers. For instance, we want most of all to keep this book concise, readable, and short. Also, our experience has `convinced` us that the short book succeeds in the job for which it was intended -- the teaching of critical-thinking questioning skills. Our experience in teaching critical-thinking skills to our students over four decades has convinced us that when individuals with `diverse` abilities are taught these skills in a simplified format, they can learn to apply them successfully. In the process, they develop greater confidence in their ability to make rational choices about social issues and personal issues, even those with which they have `formerly` had little experience.

Thus, our book continues to do a number of things that other books have failed to do. This text develops an `integrated` series of question-asking skills that can be applied widely. These skills are discussed in an informal style. (We have written to a general audience, not to any specialized group.)

One feature that deserves to be highlighted is the applicability of *Asking the Right Questions* to `numerous` life experiences extending far beyond the classroom. The habits and attitudes associated with critical thinking are transferable to consumer, medical, legal, and general `ethical` and personal choices. When a `surgeon` says `surgery` is needed, it can be life `sustaining` to seek answers to the critical questions encouraged in *Asking the Right Questions*. In addition, practicing the critical-thinking questions enhances our growth of knowledge in general and helps us better discover the way the world is, how is could be better understood, and how we can make it a better world.

Who would find *Asking the Right Questions* especially beneficial? Because of our teaching experiences with readers representing many different levels of ability, we have difficulty `envisioning` any academic course or program for which this book would not be useful. In fact, the first nine editions have been used in law, English, `pharmacy`, `philosophy`, education, `psychology`, `sociology`, religion, and social science courses, as well as in numerous high school classrooms.

A few uses for the book seem especially appropriate. Teachers in general education programs may want to begin their courses by assigning this book as a `coherent` response to their students' requests to explain what is expected of them. English courses that emphasize `expository` writing could use this text both as a format for evaluating arguments prior to constructing an essay and a checklist of problems that the writer should attempt to avoid as she writes. The text can also be used as the central focus of courses designed specifically to teach critical reading and thinking skills.

While *Asking the Right Questions* `stems` primarily from our classroom experiences, it is written so that it can guide the reading and listening habits of almost everyone. The skills that it seeks to develop are those that any critical reader needs to serve as a basis for rational decisions. The critical questions stressed in the book can enhance anyone's reasoning, regardless of the extent of his or her formal education.
