> So unless you're stuck in prison without nothing else to do, 
> **NEVER** read a non-fiction book or article from beginning to end. 
>
> Instead, when you're reading for information, you should **ALWAYS** jump ahead, 
> skip around and use every available strategy to **discover**, then to **understand**, 
> and finally to **remember** what the writer has to say. This is how you'll get tht most
> out of a book in the smallest amount of time.
